Run cluster_seqcounts.py to produce the proper csv with the sequence counts for each ref genome.

You will need to provice a sample_annotation csv that labels each ref genome in groups.

Run cluster.sequence_plots.R to produce the heatmaps of sequence presence.

Produced svgs may be problematic for editing directly in inkscape; ypu may need to rasterize them (save as png) before import into inkscape.
