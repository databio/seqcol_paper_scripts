This repository contains scripts for:

1. Downloading and processing FASTA files from various reference genome providers (brickyard_download).
2. Comparing sequence collections from FASTA files of downloaded reference genomes (seq_col_comparison).

See the corresponding README.md in each folder for operating instructions.
